# Process Reflection

* What was your process for fixing the bug there?

* Was it particularly efficient?

* If you were to encounter this bug again, would you use the exact same steps again?

* If you were on the phone and couldn’t see the code and had to tell someone else how to debug it, could you give them strategies for success?

* If you indicated a sense of variance between repeat debugging sessions, you might be lacking process. In this unit we’re going to ensure that you have a repeatable process for development and debugging
