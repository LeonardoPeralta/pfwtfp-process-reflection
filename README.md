# Process Reflection

1. How long did it take you to find and fix the bug?
2. What was your process for fixing the bug in the example? How did you find the problem?
3. If you were to encounter this bug again, would you consistently have similar results? Why or why not?
4. If you were on the phone and couldnâ€™t see the code and had to tell someone else how to debug it, could you give them strategies for success?
5. If you indicated a sense of variance between repeat debugging sessions (#2), can you identify certain steps you'd want to keep or improve?
